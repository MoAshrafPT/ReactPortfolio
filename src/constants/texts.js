const aboutMe = "Hi there! My name is Mohamed Ashraf, I'm a 21 year-old computer engineering student at Cairo University. This is my portfolio/blog where I'll be sharing with you guys my humble software engineering journey and documenting every step. I will try to post weekly updates on here and maybe more in the future if I've got some spicy news ðŸ˜‰. Please keep in consideration that what I post is my own personal opinion, I am open to discuss different takes at any time. This is simply a light hearted project for my own educational purposes";
